# PythonII

#  This is a simple jupyter notebooke that explores whether weather, specifically pressusure (i.e. rainfall), has any bearing on any calls made to the city
#  of louisville.   The files come from https://data.louisvilleky.gov/, NASA # https://power.larc.nasa.gov/downloads/POWER_Regional_Daily_20110101_20111231_b287c874.csv
#  and openstreetmap.org for the map of Louisville. 

To run, simply make sure all data files are in a single directory and pull up the pandas notbook file in Juypter Notebook.
