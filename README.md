#### This is a simple jupyter notebook that explores weather conditions, specifically pressure (i.e. rainfall), has any bearing on any calls made to the city of Louisville, Kentucky for city services related to issues like building code violations, abandoned cars, unkept yards. If such a corrleation can be detected, this may pave way for city planners to predict in advance the likelihood of certain types of service calls and possibly implement preventative measures which would lower service demand and more efficently utilize city resources.
#### Louisville Metro services data has been aquired from a city ran website and the most complete dataset has been chosen, which is from 2011. The dataset contains a history of service calls to Louisville, and each entry contains data regarding location and type of service, time and date, and whether or not the service request was complete. any correlation to the amount of precipitation. Factors that were considered where the frequency of calls made in a given district, looking in that district for the type of call, and determining whether it would have
